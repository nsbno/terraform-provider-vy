# Vy Provider

A provider for Vy's internal services.

This provider enables interaction with three core parts of Vy's infrastructure:

- **Enroll Account Service** - Register AWS accounts in Vy's AWS Organization
- **Shared Cognito (Vy Utvikling)** - Manage OAuth 2.0 resource servers and app clients for authentication
- **Version Handler Service** - Retrieve artifact versions during Terraform deployments from S3 and ECR

## Example Usage

```terraform
required_providers {
  vy = {
	source  = "nsbno/vy"
	version = ">= 0.5.0, < 1.0.0"
  }
}

provider "vy" {
  environment = "prod"
}
```
