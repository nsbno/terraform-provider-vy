# Data Source: vy_lambda_artifact

Get information about a specific Lambda artifact version. Artifacts are uploaded to S3 or ECR during the CI process.

## Using S3 Artifact

```terraform
# Get information about an S3 artifact based on GitHub repository name
data "vy_lambda_artifact" "this" {
  github_repository_name = "infrademo-demo-app"
}

# Use the S3 artifact in a Lambda module
module "lambda" {
  source = "github.com/nsbno/terraform-aws-lambda?ref=x.y.z"

  service_name  = "my-function"
  artifact_type = "s3"
  artifact      = data.vy_lambda_artifact.this
}
```

## Using ECR Images

```terraform
# Get information about an ECR Image based on GitHub repository name
data "vy_lambda_artifact" "this" {
  github_repository_name = "infrademo-demo-app"
}

# Use the ECR artifact in a Lambda module
module "lambda" {
  source = "github.com/nsbno/terraform-aws-lambda?ref=x.y.z"

  service_name  = "my-function"
  artifact_type = "ecr"
  artifact      = data.vy_lambda_artifact.this
}
```

## Mono Repo Usage

```terraform
# For monorepos, you can specify a working directory within the repository where the lambda code is stored
data "vy_lambda_artifact" "user_service" {
  github_repository_name = "infrademo-demo-app"
  working_directory      = "services/user_service"
}

# Use the S3 artifact in a Lambda module
module "lambda" {
  source = "github.com/nsbno/terraform-aws-lambda?ref=x.y.z"

  service_name  = "my-function"
  artifact_type = "s3"
  artifact      = data.vy_lambda_artifact.user_service
}

data "vy_lambda_artifact" "payment_service" {
  github_repository_name = "infrademo-demo-app"
  working_directory      = "services/payment_service"
}

module "payment_lambda" {
  source = "github.com/nsbno/terraform-aws-lambda?ref=x.y.z"

  service_name  = "my-function"
  artifact_type = "s3"
  artifact      = data.vy_lambda_artifact.payment_service
}
```
